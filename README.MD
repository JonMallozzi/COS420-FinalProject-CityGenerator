Live version of code is visible at by [clicking here](http://www.cs.usm.maine.edu/~mallozzi/finalProject/ProceduralCity.html)

All textures are in textures folder <br/>
Build contains all of the three.js files to get project to work<br/>

All code was done in ProceduralCity.html file

Screenshots of what some random versions of the city looks like is in the screenshot folder

Modules are still in the repo but since after reading a lot of posts 
on line I was still unable to load the GLTFLoader.js file
in our project. Its probably due to how the project is set up 
but honestly both of us can't figure it out so we did the 
best we could without
custom models.
